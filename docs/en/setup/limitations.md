- Obviously, no obsidian's plugin will work. Only obsidian's plugin provided with an API can be converted, as Dataview (converted in simple markdown) for example.
- `dataviewjs` is not supported
- Mkdocs and Material Mkdocs doesn't support inline tags, and you will lose link in these tags. See [[en/setup/snippets and tools#Custom tags attributes|Custom tags attributes]] for more information.
- Nested tags are not supported
