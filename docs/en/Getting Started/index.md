Mkdocs Obsidian is an association between an Obsidian plugin and a Material mkdocs template to get a personal wiki site based on your Obsidian Vault.

If you're familiar with [GitHub Pages](https://github.com/), you can directly [template](https://github.com/ObsidianPublisher/publisher-template-gh-pages/generate) the [Mkdocs Material Template](https://www.squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/).

If you prefer to use [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/), you can directly [template this](https://github.com/ObsidianPublisher/publisher-template-netlify/generate) repository.

## Installation steps
