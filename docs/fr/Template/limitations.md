# Limitations
- I prefer to encourage you to use the `shortlinks` option in obsidian's link option.
- Obsiously, no obsidian's plugin will work.
- No graph view
- mkdocs and Material Mkdocs doesn't support inline tags, and you will lose link in these tags. 	See [custom and tags attributes](../Template/customization.md#custom-and-tags-attributes) for more information.
- Nested tags are not supported
